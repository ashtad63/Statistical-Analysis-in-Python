# Statistical Analysis in Python

In this project we are going to thest the hypothesis that: \
**"University towns have their mean housing prices less effected by recessions."**

More specifically we run a *t-test* to compare the ratio of the mean price of houses in university towns \
the quarter before the recession starts compared to the recession bottom.
